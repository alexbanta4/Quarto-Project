# Quarto-Project

To run this program:
-In your install of companionsKQML, replace pythonian.py with the pythonian.py enclosed in the zip (or in the github if you're using that)
-Load up a companions interaction-manager server
-Click 'Toggle status updates' on companions to turn off pings (this is important, the game uses terminal output and it is hard to read with pings)
-Load three flatfiles into the server (Order matters!):
	-QuartoOntology.krf
	-QuartoFacts.krf
	-QuartoPlans.krf
-Run main.py to play the game once through; close and reopen for successive plays.
-Note to save time: if you start the companions server and run main once, you can close and rerun main again without restarting the companions server.
